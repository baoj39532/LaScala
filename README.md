# LaScala
A very basic set of methods to complement what's in the standard Scala library.

These definitions arose from teaching the class Big Data Systems Engineering using Scala
at Northeastern University. They don't claim to be anything very special.

No doubt it would be better to use Scalaz or Shapeless but if you only want a few
of the more basic definitions for things like map2, lift, sequence, etc. then this should do the job.
